# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on kickstarter data 
After analysing the kickstarter data it is observed that
1. it is very impoartnt to decide the goal for the campaign as when goal is less then $5000 in case of plays there are more chances of the play to be sucessful. 
None of the campaigns for the plays where cancelled , but they are few campaign which got failed over the course of time. To determine why the these fails we need more data or factors to know the possibility of why it fails

Part 2 :To check if the length of campaign contribute to sucess or failure . 
 To give conceret soluntion for this t is very important to know 
 
 1.  What is the duration which is considered short amount of time 
 as if we see the days by checking the difference between data created and date ended under plays subcategory only there are 15 records which are sucessfully completed campaign under 10 days which is like 0.3% of total dataset . 
 and we have few campaingn whihc tok more then 100 days to get  sucess full , so  considering 10 days to do this analysis is ttoo short or we sould ust take avaerage and decide the shortest duration.
 
 2. Does the name of the play also helps.
 For example if people will come across a sucessfull play as in case of louise also sh was looking data according the play she really enjoys in great braitain , so while doing analysis is it important to consider the name as well .
 
 But based on the charts one thing is very clear that over the years the plays starting between april to jun have more chances to be sucessful and in declines by the end of the year
